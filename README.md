## Sign In flow

- Every Client gets a unique client user id assigned... :)

serverMethods:

- registerGame (returns confirmGameResult with potential signup code for users)
- signInWithCode (method for players, takes in username and signup code)
- accUser (method for DMs)
- requestConfig (method for players)
- updateConfig (method for dms)

## Auth

### Peter

I need help. I am a c# dotnet backend developer with many different kinds of frontends: I like programming in flutter, angular, react, and other frontend technologies and I always get stuck on the same question:

is there no easy way to implement some authentication and authorization which handles username and password signup and oauth signin with apple or google or other vendors.

ask me questions if you need but please recommend a setup which I can implement once and future proof my apps with auth

### Chat GPT

You're in a common situation faced by developers who work across different frontends but need a unified and future-proof solution for authentication and authorization. To address your requirement—handling both traditional username/password signups and OAuth (e.g., Google, Apple) sign-ins—the best approach is to implement a backend authentication system that supports multiple types of authentication flows and is extensible for future updates.

## Solution: Use Identity Provider + OAuth

**Recommended Stack**:

1. **.NET Core / ASP.NET Identity** for user management and local username/password signup.
2. **OAuth/OIDC providers** for social login (Google, Apple, etc.).
3. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure token-based authentication, easily integrating with mobile apps (Flutter) and SPAs (Angular, React).
4. **Authorization Policies** in .NET to manage role-based or claims-based access control.

### Suggested Setup Overview

1. **Backend: ASP.NET Core Identity with OAuth Providers**
   - ASP.NET Core has built-in identity and authentication/authorization systems.
   - It integrates with OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, Apple, etc., using OAuth2/OpenID Connect.

2. **JWT Authentication**:
   - ASP.NET Core can issue JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) which are self-contained tokens that hold user information securely and can be consumed by mobile apps (Flutter) and web apps (React, Angular) for authentication and authorization.
   - Since JWT is a standard, any future frontends or APIs you build will be able to authenticate with the same system.

3. **Frontend: Implement OAuth and JWT Handling**
   - Use libraries like `flutter_oauth2` or `flutter_firebase_auth` for Flutter apps, and `oidc-client-js` for Angular/React to handle OAuth sign-in on the client side.
   - For traditional username/password signup, make a POST request to your backend API to register, and retrieve a JWT upon successful authentication.

### Detailed Implementation

#### 1. **ASP.NET Core Identity with OAuth (Backend)**

Start with ASP.NET Core Identity to manage local signups and logins.

- Install packages:

  ```bash
  dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
  dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
  ```

- Configure services in `Startup.cs`:

  ```csharp
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
  {
      // Add Identity services
      services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>()
          .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
          .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

      // Configure authentication with JWT Bearer tokens
      services.AddAuthentication(options =>
      {
          options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
          options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
      })
      .AddJwtBearer(options =>
      {
          options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
          {
              ValidateIssuer = true,
              ValidateAudience = true,
              ValidateLifetime = true,
              ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
              ValidIssuer = Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
              ValidAudience = Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
              IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Configuration["Jwt:Key"]))
          };
      })
      .AddGoogle(googleOptions =>
      {
          googleOptions.ClientId = Configuration["Authentication:Google:ClientId"];
          googleOptions.ClientSecret = Configuration["Authentication:Google:ClientSecret"];
      })
      .AddApple(appleOptions =>
      {
          appleOptions.ClientId = Configuration["Authentication:Apple:ClientId"];
          appleOptions.KeyId = Configuration["Authentication:Apple:KeyId"];
          appleOptions.TeamId = Configuration["Authentication:Apple:TeamId"];
      });
  }
  ```

- Configure token generation after successful login:

  ```csharp
  public async Task<string> GenerateJwtToken(string email, IdentityUser user)
  {
      var claims = new List<Claim>
      {
          new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, email),
          new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString())
      };

      var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_config["Jwt:Key"]));
      var creds = new SigningCredentials(key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

      var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
          issuer: _config["Jwt:Issuer"],
          audience: _config["Jwt:Issuer"],
          claims: claims,
          expires: DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30),
          signingCredentials: creds);

      return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);
  }
  ```

#### 2. **Frontend OAuth & JWT Handling**

##### Flutter

- Use the `flutter_secure_storage` package for securely storing the JWT.
- Use `flutter_appauth` for OAuth or Firebase Auth if using Firebase.

  ```dart
  final result = await appAuth.authorizeAndExchangeCode(
    AuthorizationTokenRequest(
      'client_id',
      'redirect_url',
      serviceConfiguration: AuthorizationServiceConfiguration(
        authorizationEndpoint: 'https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth',
        tokenEndpoint: 'https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token',
      ),
    ),
  );
  ```

##### React/Angular

- Use `oidc-client` or `Auth0` for handling OAuth sign-in and JWT management.

  ```js
  const userManager = new UserManager({
    authority: "https://accounts.google.com",
    client_id: "your-google-client-id",
    redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000/callback",
    response_type: "id_token token",
    scope: "openid profile",
  });

  userManager.signinRedirect();  // OAuth sign-in
  ```

#### 3. **Authorization**: Claims-based or Role-based Access Control

- In .NET Core, you can define custom roles and policies to handle different levels of authorization.
  
  ```csharp
  services.AddAuthorization(options =>
  {
      options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy => policy.RequireClaim("Admin"));
  });
  ```

### Key Advantages

1. **Unified Backend**: ASP.NET Core Identity handles both local and external authentication. It’s extensible, meaning you can add more providers (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) in the future.
2. **Token-Based Authentication**: JWT is ideal for mobile apps, SPAs, and APIs. Your frontend can easily verify and refresh tokens without a persistent session.
3. **Frontend Agnostic**: Whether you build an app in Flutter, Angular, React, or any future technology, JWT-based auth ensures consistent and reusable backend authentication.
4. **Scalable Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and claims-based authorization ensure that your solution is flexible for complex permissions in future projects.

### Steps to Future-Proof

1. **Modular OAuth Providers**: If new vendors or login methods emerge, you can easily extend the system by adding new authentication schemes.
2. **Upgrade-Ready JWT Handling**: JWT allows easy scaling to microservices or distributed architectures, as each service can independently verify the token.

By adopting this approach, you'll have a flexible, scalable authentication and authorization system that works across multiple frontends and can adapt as new login methods or frontends emerge.

### Peter

okay i have some questions regarding this solution: how Can a user register with username and password?

### ChatGPT

To allow users to register with a **username and password** in the **ASP.NET Core Identity** setup, you need to expose an API endpoint that handles user registration. ASP.NET Core Identity provides a straightforward way to handle this through its user management services.

### Steps for Username and Password Registration

1. **Define a Registration API Endpoint**: You'll create a POST endpoint where users can send their username, password, and any other registration details. This endpoint will use `UserManager` provided by ASP.NET Core Identity to register the user.

2. **Handling User Registration**: In the API endpoint, you can use the `UserManager.CreateAsync()` method to create a user with the specified username and password.

### Example of Username and Password Registration

1. **Controller Code**:

In your controller, you will define a method for registration. It will take the user’s credentials (username, password) in the request body, create the user, and return an appropriate response.

Here’s how you can implement this in ASP.NET Core:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class AuthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly UserManager<IdentityUser> _userManager;

    public AuthController(UserManager<IdentityUser> userManager)
    {
        _userManager = userManager;
    }

    // Registration endpoint
    [HttpPost("register")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Register([FromBody] RegisterModel model)
    {
        // Check if the model state is valid (e.g., password length, etc.)
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest(ModelState);
        }

        // Create a new user
        var user = new IdentityUser { UserName = model.Username, Email = model.Email };
        var result = await _userManager.CreateAsync(user, model.Password);

        // Check if the registration was successful
        if (result.Succeeded)
        {
            return Ok(new { message = "User registered successfully" });
        }

        // If failed, return the errors
        return BadRequest(result.Errors);
    }
}
```

2. **Register Model**:
   You'll need a model to accept the registration details (e.g., `Username`, `Password`, and optionally `Email`).

```csharp
public class RegisterModel
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    
    public string Email { get; set; }

    public string Password { get; set; }
}
```

3. **UserManager Service**:
   The `UserManager<IdentityUser>` service is responsible for interacting with the Identity system to handle user creation. The `CreateAsync()` method will attempt to create the user with the provided username and password, and it will enforce any password policies that you've defined in your Identity configuration.

4. **Password Requirements**:
   You can configure password requirements in the `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` if using .NET 6 and beyond) during the Identity setup.

```csharp
services.Configure<IdentityOptions>(options =>
{
    // Password settings
    options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
    options.Password.RequiredLength = 6;
    options.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = false;
    options.Password.RequireUppercase = true;
    options.Password.RequireLowercase = false;
});
```

### Explanation

- **UserManager**: The `UserManager` service is injected into the controller and is responsible for managing user-related operations like creating new users, updating passwords, finding users by username, etc.
- **CreateAsync**: This method creates the user with the provided credentials. It takes two arguments:
  1. **IdentityUser**: This object represents the user to be created and includes properties like `UserName` and `Email`.
  2. **Password**: The password will be hashed and stored securely in the database.

### Result

- If the registration is successful, the response will indicate that the user was registered.
- If there’s an error (e.g., username already taken, password too weak), the method will return a bad request with the list of validation errors.

### Password Hashing

ASP.NET Core Identity automatically hashes passwords using a secure algorithm (by default, PBKDF2) before storing them in the database. This ensures that passwords are not stored in plain text.

### Registration Process in Summary

1. The frontend (e.g., your Flutter or Angular app) makes a POST request to the `/register` API endpoint with the user’s username, email, and password.
2. The backend validates the input and creates a new user with a hashed password.
3. If successful, the user is registered, and you can either log them in directly by issuing a JWT token, or ask them to log in via the `/login` endpoint.

### Example Request (Frontend -> Backend)

Here’s an example JSON body for the registration request:

```json
{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "testuser@example.com",
    "password": "P@ssword1"
}
```

This request would be sent as a POST to the `/register` endpoint.

---

### Optional: Auto-login after Registration

To streamline the user experience, you can automatically log the user in after successful registration by generating and returning a JWT immediately.

You would modify the `Register` method like this:

```csharp
if (result.Succeeded)
{
    // Automatically log in the user and generate a JWT token
    var token = await GenerateJwtToken(user.Email, user);
    return Ok(new { token });
}
```

This way, once a user registers, they can start using the app without having to log in separately.

### Next Steps

- Once registration is set up, you’ll need to create a **login** endpoint (if it's not OAuth) that issues JWT tokens when users log in with their username and password. This will allow your frontend apps to authenticate users and access protected resources.

### Peter

how would that login endpoint look like

### ChatGPT

The login endpoint will allow users to authenticate using their username and password. Once authenticated, the server will generate and return a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** that the client (Flutter, React, Angular, etc.) can use for subsequent requests to access protected resources.

Below is a detailed implementation of the **login endpoint** in an ASP.NET Core API using **ASP.NET Core Identity**.

### Steps to Implement the Login Endpoint

1. **Accept Login Credentials**: The login endpoint will receive the user's credentials (username and password) via a POST request.
2. **Validate Credentials**: Use `SignInManager` to check the credentials against the stored data.
3. **Generate JWT**: If the credentials are valid, generate a JWT that includes user claims, such as username and roles.
4. **Return JWT**: Return the token to the client for use in authorization.

### Example Code for Login Endpoint

#### 1. **Login Endpoint in Controller**

Here is how you can implement the login functionality in a controller.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt;
using System.Security.Claims;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens;
using System.Text;
using System;

public class AuthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly SignInManager<IdentityUser> _signInManager;
    private readonly UserManager<IdentityUser> _userManager;
    private readonly IConfiguration _config;

    public AuthController(SignInManager<IdentityUser> signInManager, UserManager<IdentityUser> userManager, IConfiguration config)
    {
        _signInManager = signInManager;
        _userManager = userManager;
        _config = config;
    }

    [HttpPost("login")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginModel model)
    {
        // Find the user by username
        var user = await _userManager.FindByNameAsync(model.Username);

        if (user == null)
        {
            return Unauthorized("Invalid login attempt.");
        }

        // Check if the password is correct
        var result = await _signInManager.CheckPasswordSignInAsync(user, model.Password, false);

        if (result.Succeeded)
        {
            // Generate a JWT Token for the user
            var tokenString = await GenerateJwtToken(user);
            return Ok(new { token = tokenString });
        }

        return Unauthorized("Invalid login attempt.");
    }

    private async Task<string> GenerateJwtToken(IdentityUser user)
    {
        // Fetch user roles (if any)
        var roles = await _userManager.GetRolesAsync(user);

        // Create claims for JWT
        var claims = new[]
        {
            new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, user.UserName),
            new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, user.Id)
        };

        var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(_config["Jwt:Key"]));
        var creds = new SigningCredentials(key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

        var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
            issuer: _config["Jwt:Issuer"],
            audience: _config["Jwt:Issuer"],
            claims: claims,
            expires: DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30),
            signingCredentials: creds);

        return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);
    }
}
```

#### 2. **LoginModel**

The `LoginModel` class will hold the data passed in the body of the request (username and password).

```csharp
public class LoginModel
{
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
}
```

#### 3. **Token Generation Method**

The `GenerateJwtToken` method creates the JWT using the user's details. This method:

- Includes claims like `UserName` and `UserId`.
- Signs the token with a symmetric key defined in the configuration.
- Sets a token expiration time (e.g., 30 minutes).
- Uses `JwtSecurityTokenHandler` to generate the token.

### 4. **JWT Configuration**

You'll need to store the JWT settings in your `appsettings.json` file.

```json
"Jwt": {
  "Key": "your-secure-key",
  "Issuer": "your-app-name",
  "Audience": "your-app-name"
}
```

Make sure the `Key` is a secure, long, and randomly generated string.

### 5. **Configure JWT in Startup.cs**

In the `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` for newer .NET versions), you need to configure JWT authentication in the `ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddAuthentication(options =>
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddJwtBearer(options =>
    {
        options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = true,
            ValidateAudience = true,
            ValidateLifetime = true,
            ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
            ValidIssuer = Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
            ValidAudience = Configuration["Jwt:Issuer"],
            IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(Configuration["Jwt:Key"]))
        };
    });

    // Add Identity services
    services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>()
        .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>()
        .AddDefaultTokenProviders();
}
```

### Example Request for Login

The frontend (e.g., Flutter, React, Angular) would make a POST request to the `/login` endpoint with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "P@ssword1"
}
```

### Example Response

If the credentials are correct, the response will include the JWT token:

```json
{
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

The client can then store this JWT (e.g., in **localStorage** for web apps or **secure storage** for mobile apps like Flutter) and use it in the `Authorization` header for subsequent API calls.

```http
GET /api/protected-resource
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Error Handling

- If the user doesn’t exist or the password is incorrect, the server will return a 401 Unauthorized response with an appropriate message:
  
```json
{
    "message": "Invalid login attempt."
}
```

### Key Points

- **SignInManager**: ASP.NET Core’s `SignInManager` handles password validation and user sign-in checks.
- **JWT Claims**: You can add custom claims such as roles, permissions, or other user-specific data when generating the JWT.
- **JWT Security**: Ensure the JWT signing key is long and random, and that you handle token expiration and refresh strategies for longer sessions if needed.

This setup allows your frontends to authenticate users using their username and password, receive a JWT, and then use that token to authorize subsequent requests.

### Peter

I know that oauth or oidc uses a concept with access tokens and refresh tokens. wouldn't it be wise to implement something similar so that the users don't have to sign in every 30 minutes after their jwt expire or what would you recommend how to make this even more secure?

### Chat GPT

You're absolutely right! Implementing **access tokens** and **refresh tokens** is a common practice in OAuth2 and OIDC, and it's a wise approach when using JWTs to ensure a balance between **security** and **user experience**.

Access tokens (short-lived) ensure security, while refresh tokens (long-lived) allow users to maintain their session without re-authenticating frequently. This pattern avoids requiring users to log in again every time their JWT expires.

### Why Use Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens?

- **Access Token**: A short-lived token (e.g., 30 minutes) used for authorization in API requests. If compromised, its short lifespan limits the potential damage.
- **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token (e.g., several days or weeks) stored securely and used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires, without requiring the user to log in again.
- **Security**: Since access tokens expire quickly, they reduce the risk of prolonged misuse if stolen. Refresh tokens are generally more securely stored (e.g., HttpOnly cookies) and can be revoked if a session is compromised.

### Recommended Flow: Access Token + Refresh Token

1. **User logs in** and receives two tokens:
   - **Access token** (short-lived JWT)
   - **Refresh token** (long-lived)

2. **Access token** is used in each API call to authenticate the user.

3. When the **access token expires**, the frontend uses the **refresh token** to request a new access token from the backend.

4. **Refresh token rotation**: Every time a new access token is issued, a new refresh token is issued as well, making the previous refresh token invalid. This minimizes the risk of refresh token replay attacks.

5. **Revoke tokens**: If the user logs out or if there is suspicious activity, both the access token and the refresh token are invalidated, forcing the user to log in again.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. **Login Endpoint with Refresh Token**

When the user logs in successfully, in addition to the access token, return a refresh token:

```csharp
[HttpPost("login")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login([FromBody] LoginModel model)
{
    var user = await _userManager.FindByNameAsync(model.Username);

    if (user == null)
    {
        return Unauthorized("Invalid login attempt.");
    }

    var result = await _signInManager.CheckPasswordSignInAsync(user, model.Password, false);

    if (result.Succeeded)
    {
        var accessToken = await GenerateJwtToken(user);
        var refreshToken = GenerateRefreshToken();

        // Store refresh token in the database (e.g., in a table with userId, token, and expiration)
        await SaveRefreshToken(user.Id, refreshToken);

        return Ok(new { accessToken, refreshToken });
    }

    return Unauthorized("Invalid login attempt.");
}
```

#### 2. **Generate Refresh Token**

A refresh token is typically a long random string. You’ll generate it using a cryptographically secure method:

```csharp
private string GenerateRefreshToken()
{
    var randomNumber = new byte[32];
    using (var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create())
    {
        rng.GetBytes(randomNumber);
        return Convert.ToBase64String(randomNumber);
    }
}
```

You would also need to store the refresh token in the database along with the user ID, its expiration time, and whether it has been revoked (if you’re using refresh token rotation).

#### 3. **Token Refresh Endpoint**

This endpoint is used by the client to get a new access token when the current one expires. The client sends the refresh token, and if it’s valid, the server issues a new access token (and possibly a new refresh token).

```csharp
[HttpPost("refresh")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Refresh([FromBody] TokenModel model)
{
    // Validate the refresh token
    var storedToken = await GetRefreshToken(model.RefreshToken);

    if (storedToken == null || storedToken.IsExpired || storedToken.IsRevoked)
    {
        return Unauthorized("Invalid refresh token.");
    }

    // Get the user associated with the refresh token
    var user = await _userManager.FindByIdAsync(storedToken.UserId);
    if (user == null)
    {
        return Unauthorized();
    }

    // Generate a new access token
    var newAccessToken = await GenerateJwtToken(user);
    var newRefreshToken = GenerateRefreshToken();

    // Optionally revoke the old refresh token and store the new one
    storedToken.IsRevoked = true;
    await SaveRefreshToken(user.Id, newRefreshToken);

    return Ok(new { accessToken = newAccessToken, refreshToken = newRefreshToken });
}
```

#### 4. **Token Storage**

- **Access token**: The frontend (React, Angular, Flutter) stores this in memory or local storage and includes it in the `Authorization` header when making API requests:
  
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
  ```

- **Refresh token**: The refresh token should be stored securely. The safest place to store it in a web application is in an **HttpOnly cookie** that is only accessible by the server, preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing it (this mitigates XSS attacks). In mobile apps (Flutter), you can store it in secure storage.

#### 5. **Security Best Practices**

1. **Refresh Token Rotation**: Each time the client requests a new access token with the refresh token, return a new refresh token and invalidate the old one. This reduces the risk of a stolen refresh token being reused.

2. **Token Expiration**:
   - **Access tokens** should have a short expiration time (e.g., 15–30 minutes).
   - **Refresh tokens** should have a longer expiration time (e.g., days, weeks, or even months), but set a reasonable expiry to minimize long-term exposure.

3. **Revoke Refresh Tokens**:
   - Provide the ability to revoke refresh tokens when users log out or when suspicious activity is detected.
   - This requires storing refresh tokens in a database so that they can be invalidated if necessary.

4. **Secure Storage**:
   - **HttpOnly Cookies**: For web applications, store the refresh token in an HttpOnly, Secure cookie to prevent it from being accessed via JavaScript.
   - **Secure Storage for Mobile**: For mobile applications (Flutter), use secure storage like `flutter_secure_storage` to store the refresh token safely.

5. **Token Binding**: Optionally, bind the refresh token to some client-specific information (such as IP address or device) so that it can only be used from the original client that requested it.

#### 6. **Logging Out**

When the user logs out, both the access and refresh tokens should be invalidated.

```csharp
[HttpPost("logout")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Logout()
{
    var userId = User.FindFirstValue(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier);

    // Invalidate all refresh tokens for the user
    await RevokeAllUserTokens(userId);

    return Ok(new { message = "Logged out successfully" });
}
```

This can be done by setting the `IsRevoked` flag on all refresh tokens associated with the user in the database.

### Example Login Response

When the user logs in, the server sends back both the access and refresh tokens:

```json
{
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "refreshToken": "r0nd0mR3fr35hT0k3n..."
}
```

The frontend stores these tokens appropriately:

- **Access token**: In local storage or memory (but never in cookies due to CSRF risk).
- **Refresh token**: In a secure cookie (web) or secure storage (mobile).

### Refresh Flow

1. The frontend detects that the access token is expired.
2. It sends the refresh token to the `/refresh` endpoint to get a new access token.
3. If valid, the server issues a new access token and refresh token, both of which are sent back to the client.

---

### Summary of Benefits

- **Improved Security**: By using short-lived access tokens, the risk from token theft is minimized. Refresh tokens can be stored securely and revoked if compromised.
- **Better User Experience**: Users don't need to log in again after their access token expires, as long as they have a valid refresh token.
- **Scalability**: The system can easily handle multiple devices or sessions per user by tracking refresh tokens in a database.

By following this approach, you'll create a secure, flexible, and user-friendly authentication system for your apps.

### Peter

in case of the login through Sign in with Apple: how are refresh tokens handled?

### ChatGPT

When integrating **Sign in with Apple** or other **OAuth2** providers (like Google, Facebook), refresh tokens are handled differently compared to local authentication (username/password). In OAuth2 flows, the **refresh token** is issued by the **OAuth provider** (in this case, Apple), not your backend server. Your role is to securely store and manage that refresh token, and use it to obtain new access tokens from Apple when needed.

Here's how **refresh tokens** are handled when using **Sign in with Apple**:

### 1. **OAuth2 Flow with Apple (Authorization Code Flow)**

**Sign in with Apple** follows the **OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow**, which looks like this:

1. **User initiates sign-in**: The user clicks the "Sign in with Apple" button, which redirects them to Apple’s login page.
2. **Authorization code is received**: After successful login, Apple redirects back to your backend with an **authorization code**.
3. **Backend exchanges the authorization code**: Your backend server sends the authorization code to Apple's servers in exchange for:
   - An **access token** (short-lived, typically ~60 minutes).
   - A **refresh token** (long-lived, used to get new access tokens when the short-lived one expires).
   - An **ID token** (which contains user information, similar to a JWT).

### 2. **Apple’s Refresh Token Handling**

- **Access tokens** (short-lived) are what you use to make API calls to Apple's services on behalf of the user.
- **Refresh tokens** (long-lived) allow your backend to request new access tokens from Apple without requiring the user to log in again.
- **Apple refresh tokens do not expire** unless they are explicitly revoked by the user or by Apple.

### 3. **Handling Refresh Tokens in Sign in with Apple Flow**

Here's how to manage refresh tokens for **Sign in with Apple**:

#### A. **Receiving and Storing the Refresh Token**

When your backend exchanges the authorization code for tokens, Apple responds with both an **access token** and a **refresh token**.

Example of the token exchange request:

```http
POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
grant_type=authorization_code
code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
```

Apple's response will look like this:

```json
{
    "access_token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "REFRESH_TOKEN",
    "id_token": "ID_TOKEN"
}
```

You should:

1. **Store the access token** (in memory or cache) for immediate use in API calls (expires in ~60 minutes).
2. **Store the refresh token securely** (e.g., in a database) to refresh the access token when it expires.

#### B. **Refreshing the Access Token**

When the access token expires, your backend uses the stored **refresh token** to get a new access token. This is similar to the `/refresh` token flow in local authentication, but you now send the refresh token to Apple's servers to get a new access token.

Example of refreshing the token:

```http
POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
grant_type=refresh_token
refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN
```

Apple responds with a new access token:

```json
{
    "access_token": "NEW_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "NEW_REFRESH_TOKEN"
}
```

You can then:

1. **Replace the old access token** with the new one.
2. **Optionally replace the old refresh token** if Apple sends a new one (Apple may or may not return a new refresh token with each request).

#### C. **Token Expiration and Revocation**

- **Access tokens** expire after a short period (~60 minutes), so you should refresh them when they expire.
- **Refresh tokens** issued by Apple **don’t expire** but can be revoked:
  - The user revokes authorization from the Apple ID settings.
  - The app is uninstalled, which invalidates the refresh token.
  - The backend should handle cases where a refresh token is revoked and guide the user to re-authenticate if needed.

### 4. **Revoking Tokens (Logout/Signout)**

If the user logs out or you want to revoke their session, you can send a request to Apple's token revocation endpoint:

```http
POST https://appleid.apple.com/auth/revoke
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
token=REFRESH_TOKEN_OR_ACCESS_TOKEN
token_type_hint=refresh_token
```

This endpoint allows you to revoke either the access token or refresh token, ensuring that the user's session is fully terminated.

### 5. **Securing Refresh Tokens**

- **Secure storage**: Store refresh tokens securely in your database. Treat them like passwords; they should be encrypted or stored in a secure vault.
- **Access token usage**: Only keep access tokens in memory or in a short-lived cache since they expire quickly and have limited use.
- **Rotation**: Apple doesn’t typically rotate refresh tokens on each request, but you should be prepared to handle cases where Apple sends a new refresh token with the response.

### Example: Full Flow for Sign in with Apple

1. **User initiates login via Apple**.
2. **Backend exchanges the authorization code** for an access token, refresh token, and ID token.
3. **Backend stores the refresh token** securely and uses the access token for immediate API calls.
4. **Access token expires**: Backend detects this and uses the stored refresh token to request a new access token.
5. **Access token is refreshed**: Backend stores the new access token and, if necessary, replaces the refresh token.
6. **User logs out**: Backend revokes both the access token and refresh token via Apple’s revocation endpoint.

### Implementation Example in .NET

#### Token Exchange (Initial Login)

```csharp
public async Task<AppleTokenResponse> ExchangeAuthorizationCodeForTokens(string authorizationCode)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();

    var requestContent = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        { "client_id", _clientId },
        { "client_secret", _clientSecret },
        { "grant_type", "authorization_code" },
        { "code", authorizationCode },
        { "redirect_uri", _redirectUri }
    });

    var response = await client.PostAsync("https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token", requestContent);
    var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<AppleTokenResponse>(responseContent);
}
```

#### Refresh Token

```csharp
public async Task<AppleTokenResponse> RefreshAppleAccessToken(string refreshToken)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();

    var requestContent = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        { "client_id", _clientId },
        { "client_secret", _clientSecret },
        { "grant_type", "refresh_token" },
        { "refresh_token", refreshToken }
    });

    var response = await client.PostAsync("https://appleid.apple.com/auth/token", requestContent);
    var responseContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<AppleTokenResponse>(responseContent);
}
```

#### Revoking Token (Logout)

```csharp
public async Task RevokeAppleToken(string token)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();

    var requestContent = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new Dictionary<string, string>
    {
        { "client_id", _clientId },
        { "client_secret", _clientSecret },
        { "token", token },
        { "token_type_hint", "refresh_token" }
    });

    await client.PostAsync("https://appleid.apple.com/auth/revoke", requestContent);
}
```

### Summary

- **Access tokens** from Apple expire quickly (~60 minutes).
- **Refresh tokens** are used to obtain new access tokens and are long-lived unless revoked.
- You securely store refresh tokens in your database and use them to refresh access tokens as needed.
- Apple's refresh tokens are not rotated frequently, but you must handle cases where they are.
- In the case of token expiration or logout, tokens can be revoked using Apple's token revocation endpoint.

### Peter

would you recommend using my own refresh tokens once a user has signed in with an oidc provider?

### ChatGPT

Using your own **refresh tokens** in conjunction with an **OIDC provider** can be a practical and flexible approach, but it depends on your use case, security model, and how much control you want over the session lifecycle. Let me explain the pros and cons of handling **refresh tokens** yourself versus relying solely on the OIDC provider's refresh tokens.

### When to Use Your Own Refresh Tokens

1. **Unified Token Management**: If you want to manage all user sessions (both local users and OIDC users) in a consistent way, handling your own **refresh tokens** provides you with full control over token expiration, revocation, and rotation.

2. **Custom Token Lifetimes**: You can define custom lifetimes for both access and refresh tokens that fit your application's needs. This allows you to control how long a user session lasts, independently of the OIDC provider's token expiration policies.

3. **Improved Security Handling**:
   - If you want to avoid storing or depending on the OIDC provider's refresh tokens in your backend (especially if the provider does not rotate refresh tokens), using your own refresh tokens can allow you to securely handle session persistence with regular token rotation.
   - You can implement features like **refresh token rotation** and **revoke** refresh tokens on your own, giving you better control over security and preventing refresh token misuse or replay attacks.

4. **Standardizing Across Providers**: Different providers (e.g., Google, Apple, Facebook) have varying token management mechanisms (e.g., Apple's refresh tokens don't expire but can be revoked, while Google rotates them). By issuing your own refresh tokens, you can standardize the way tokens are handled across all OIDC providers.

5. **Control Over Session Duration**: Some OIDC providers don’t give much flexibility in terms of token expiration and session management. By using your own refresh tokens, you can control session duration regardless of the provider’s limitations.

6. **Persistent Sessions Across Providers**: If your app supports multiple OIDC providers, issuing your own refresh tokens creates a unified mechanism for handling user sessions across various identity providers. This can simplify your backend logic and enable a more seamless session management approach.

### How It Works

1. **User Signs In with OIDC Provider**: After the user successfully signs in with an OIDC provider (e.g., Apple, Google), you get an **access token** and a **refresh token** from the provider.

2. **Issue Your Own Access and Refresh Tokens**: After the user is authenticated, instead of using the provider's access token directly in your app, you issue your own **JWT-based access token** and a **refresh token**.

   - **Access token**: Short-lived JWT token (e.g., 15–30 minutes) used to authenticate requests to your backend.
   - **Refresh token**: Long-lived token (e.g., a few days or weeks) stored in your database and used to issue new access tokens when needed.

3. **Handle Token Expiration and Refresh**:
   - When the access token expires, the frontend can request a new one using your refresh token.
   - Your backend checks the validity of your refresh token and, if valid, issues a new access token and optionally a new refresh token.
   - **Important**: You’ll need to ensure that the OIDC provider’s access token is still valid (since your tokens are independent), but you can do this in the background, asynchronously, or at regular intervals.

4. **Optional: Store OIDC Provider's Refresh Token**: You might still want to store the provider's refresh token in case your own tokens expire and you need to fetch a new access token from the provider to maintain the user's authenticated session. This can serve as a backup in case of extended sessions.

5. **Revoke OIDC Tokens Upon Logout**: When the user logs out, you should:
   - Revoke both your own refresh token and access token.
   - Optionally revoke the OIDC provider's refresh token by calling the provider’s revocation endpoint.

### Example Flow

#### 1. **Sign In with Google (OIDC)**

- The user signs in using Google, and Google returns an **ID token**, **access token**, and optionally a **refresh token**.
  
#### 2. **Issue Your Own Tokens**

- After verifying the Google ID token and user info, issue your own **JWT access token** (short-lived) and a **refresh token** (long-lived) to the user.
  
#### 3. **Refresh Access Token**

- When the access token expires, the frontend sends a request to your `/refresh` endpoint, providing your refresh token.
  
- Your backend checks your refresh token, and if valid, issues a new **access token** and optionally a new refresh token.

#### 4. **Optional: Use OIDC Provider's Refresh Token**

- If your refresh token expires or the OIDC provider's access token expires, you can use the provider’s refresh token to get a new access token from them in the background.

- Your backend may handle this in one of two ways:
  - Automatically refresh the OIDC provider’s access token when your token expires and a new token is needed.
  - Notify the frontend that the user needs to re-authenticate if the OIDC refresh token is invalid (e.g., user revoked access via Google settings).

### Example Implementation

**1. Sign-In and Token Issuance (Backend)**:

```csharp
[HttpPost("oidc-signin")]
public async Task<IActionResult> OidcSignIn([FromBody] OidcSignInModel model)
{
    var oidcToken = await ValidateOidcToken(model.Provider, model.IdToken);

    if (oidcToken == null)
    {
        return Unauthorized("Invalid OIDC token.");
    }

    // Issue your own access token
    var accessToken = await GenerateJwtToken(oidcToken.User);

    // Issue your own refresh token
    var refreshToken = GenerateRefreshToken();
    await SaveRefreshToken(oidcToken.User.Id, refreshToken);

    return Ok(new { accessToken, refreshToken });
}
```

**2. Refresh Token Flow**:

```csharp
[HttpPost("refresh")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Refresh([FromBody] RefreshTokenRequest model)
{
    var storedRefreshToken = await GetStoredRefreshToken(model.RefreshToken);
    
    if (storedRefreshToken == null || storedRefreshToken.IsExpired)
    {
        return Unauthorized("Invalid refresh token.");
    }

    var newAccessToken = await GenerateJwtToken(storedRefreshToken.User);
    var newRefreshToken = GenerateRefreshToken();

    await UpdateRefreshToken(storedRefreshToken, newRefreshToken);

    return Ok(new { accessToken = newAccessToken, refreshToken = newRefreshToken });
}
```

**3. Token Revocation (Logout)**:

```csharp
[HttpPost("logout")]
public async Task<IActionResult> Logout([FromBody] LogoutModel model)
{
    var userId = GetUserIdFromToken(model.AccessToken);

    await RevokeUserTokens(userId);

    // Optionally, revoke the OIDC provider's refresh token
    await RevokeOidcProviderToken(userId, model.ProviderRefreshToken);

    return Ok("Logged out successfully.");
}
```

### Pros of Using Your Own Refresh Tokens

1. **Consistency**: You have full control over how tokens are managed, regardless of which OIDC provider the user authenticates with. You can use the same token policies (expiration, rotation, revocation) for both local and external (OIDC) users.

2. **Custom Security**: You can implement custom security policies, such as more frequent token rotations, advanced session management, and custom token expiration settings, ensuring your application’s security model is followed.

3. **Flexibility**: You can easily extend or revoke sessions without relying on the OIDC provider’s token behavior.

### Cons of Using Your Own Refresh Tokens

1. **Complexity**: Adding your own token management system on top of OIDC can add complexity to your architecture. You’ll need to handle additional logic for checking the validity of your own tokens and potentially refreshing the OIDC provider’s tokens in the background.

2. **OIDC Refresh Token Usage**: In some cases, you may still need to store the OIDC provider’s refresh token (to get new access tokens from the provider), and managing both your refresh tokens and theirs can add some complexity.

3. **Extra Storage**: You’ll need to securely store your refresh tokens in a database and manage their lifecycle (rotation, expiration, revocation).

### Conclusion

Using your own **refresh tokens** after a user signs in with an OIDC provider can offer significant benefits in terms of **unified session management**, **security control**, and **token consistency** across different authentication methods. However, it adds some complexity since you’ll need to maintain your own token infrastructure while potentially handling OIDC provider tokens in the background.

In most cases, it's a great approach if you want to standardize token management across your application, allowing you to handle sessions in a consistent and secure way.
